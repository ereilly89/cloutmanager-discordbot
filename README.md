# Features

# 1. Virtual Cryptocurrency & Blockchain

Introduce cryptocurrency to your discord server in the form of "bitclout", simulating an actual blockchain using MongoDB.  Members can stay active in the server by "mining" one new block each day to claim their daily crypto; doing so will add a new block the chain along with all previous transactions since the last daily credits were claimed.  Daily rewards for mining new blocks are "halved" after a sufficient number of dailies have been claimed on the server (2,441).  These "halvings" continue until a hard cap of 10,000,000 bitclout have been mined. 

# 2. Automatic Role Manager
Democratizes member roles in your server with automatic promotion/demotion using a scoring system where members may positively and negatively react to others' posts.  Doing so increases and decreases that user's "clout". Server administrators may set clout thresholds for certain roles.  Users with enough positive reactions will be promoted while users with negative reactions can be demoted.
